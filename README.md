# CS-370

For this project, I was given starter code for a Treasure Maze game. My part in this project required me to complete the code for the main training loop within the q-train function. I was given pseudocode as an example to build from. I had to make sure the game finished with 100% completion in the most efficent amount of time.

Computer scientists use their knowledge to create systems that analyze data and automate various processes. Their work matters because it allows for people to solve or work with complex problems and situations more efficiently than ever before. As a computer scientist, I break down problems into smaller parts. This allows me to test my solutions more efficiently and solve additional issues not present earlier.

My ethical responsiblities are to ensure my software is fair and transparent for the user. I will also try to avoid creating biased algorithms to make sure that output does not harm any individuals. I will also make sure that all data collected is safely protected from outside entities in every way possible.
